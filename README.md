# scGCO

R wrapper for scGCO.

[scGCO](https://github.com/WangPeng-Lab/scGCO) (Single-cell Graph Cuts
Optimization), by [Zhang et al.,
2018](https://doi.org/10.1101/491472), is a method to identify genes
demonstrating position-dependent differential expression patterns,
also known as spatially variable genes, using the graph cuts
algorithm.

## Aim of the repository

  - create a wrapper for scGCO in R, using `reticulate` and `basilisk`
  - create a short script with an example workflow showing how to use
    the wrapper
